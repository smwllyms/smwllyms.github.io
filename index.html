            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, traveler! I am Sam Williams, a computer scientist and programmer specializing
                in web-accessibility and audio program development. <br/><br/>My driving force in this world is
                to help create a knowledgeable community of programmers that contribute to open-source
                and educational programs and applications (for FREE) to help others learn about programming
                and computer science! Specifically, I'd like to improve general knowledge on the development
                of audio plugins like VSTs. Most of my work and projects focus on these two areas.
            </p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                I am a Junior at Virginia Tech planning to earn my Bachelor's in Computer Science in the
                fall of 2022 (but who knows?). I am apart of Virginia Tech's Distributed Virtual Environments
                (DVE) Lab that specializes in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and eXtended Reality (XR). I have a
                bachelor's degree in computer science, am currently working towards a master's degree in computer
                science, and plan to pursue a Ph. D in computer science.

                I am very motivated to spread my knowledge accross the world! I put much of my work on GitHub as
                open source educational material. I love developing in JavaScript and HTML because it's how I 
                prototype most of my projects. I then use GitHub pages to host them (guess what this site is
                hosted on?) Here are some of my favorites you can check out by clicking on the boxes:

                    <p>
                        Check out some of my work with the famous audio-processing Discrete and Fast Fourier 
                        Transform (DFT and FFT) algorithms! Explore an online calculator that showcases a 
                        variety of optomized algorithms for calculating FT and IFTs of input values, and visit 
                        the live fourier analysis where you can watch the algorithm at work as it guesses the 
                        pitch of oscillators or audio input from your microphone!

                    <h3>Online Audio Plugin Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Explore audio processing in my plug-and-play web browser-based audio plugin GUI development
                        sandbox! Whew, that was a mouthful. This work-in-progress is part of a larger project where
                        I hope to exponentially improve VST development time by allowing prototyping in this sandbox. 
                        If you've ever tried developing VSTs using Steinberg's SDK, you know how time consuming and 
                        redundant much of it is.

                    <h3>Online x86 Assembly Sandbox and Debugger</h3>
                    <p>
                        This online x86 assembly sandbox and debugger allows you to visualize and manipulate an 
                        x86 program's memory and stack during runtime. There is also a console that supports some
                        functional operations including breakpoints (line and conditional), custom labelling, and 
                        more. Assembly from Ghidra can
                        be directly imported (so long as the instructions are functional and label references are 
                        resolvable).

            <h2>Music & Audio</h2>
            <p>
                I have had a very musical life. Music is definitely one of my favorite things about living. 
                Although I love many different types of genres of music, there's nothing to me like 
                electronic dance music (EDM). Finding EDM changed my life forever. It inspired me to become 
                a music producer and work almost daily on creating music. I first started in FL studio back
                when I was just 13 years old in 2014. Almost 10 years later, I'm still out here doin my thing.
                Feel free to check me out on SoundCloud <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sqfx3" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I must give my thanks to SoundCloud for providing a FREE platform for me to share my music!
                However, due to their generosity, there are upload limits, and since I've been producing music 
                for over 8 years, I've created a few accounts. Here they are listed in order from most recent:
