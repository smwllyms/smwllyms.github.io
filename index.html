                <p>
                    I am Sam Williams, a computer scientist and engineer specializing
                    in web applications and design, programming education, and audio programming. <br/><br/>My driving force in this world is
                    to help create a knowledgeable community of programmers that contribute to open-source
                    and educational programs and applications to help others learn about programming
                    and computer science! Specifically, I'd like to improve general knowledge on the development
                    of audio plugins like VSTs. 
                </p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
                I was a part of Virginia Tech's Distributed Virtual Environments
                (DVE) Lab that specializes in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and eXtended Reality (XR). I have
                B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Virginia Tech. I am an alum of the Galipatia living and learning community.
                I also taught as an adjunct instructor for an introductory course to GUI, computer graphics and full-stack development.

                I am very motivated to spread my knowledge accross the world! I put much of my work on GitHub as
                open source educational material. I love developing in JavaScript and HTML because it's how I 
                prototype most of my projects. I then use GitHub pages to host them. Here are some of my favorites that you can check out for yourself:

                    Mepository is a virtual journal for you to record your feelings, achievements, and notable events in your life, allowing you to reflect, learn, and grow as a person all in one place. You are provided an interactive calendar to navigate and record your thoughts, feelings, and anything else you'd like to jot down. This app provides you somewhere accessible and easy to navigate to record and later reflect on your experiences through life, on a variety of temporal scales.

                        Check out some of my work with the famous audio-processing Discrete and Fast Fourier 
                        Transform (DFT and FFT) algorithms! Explore an online calculator that showcases a 
                        variety of optomized algorithms for calculating FT and IFTs of input values, and visit 
                        the live fourier analysis where you can watch the algorithm at work as it guesses the 
                        pitch of oscillators or audio input from your microphone!

                        Explore audio processing in my plug-and-play web browser-based audio plugin GUI development
                        sandbox! This work-in-progress is part of a larger project where
                        I hope to exponentially improve VST development time by allowing prototyping in this sandbox. 
                        If you've ever tried developing VSTs using Steinberg's SDK, you know how time consuming and 
                        redundant much of it is.

                        This online x86 assembly sandbox and debugger allows you to visualize and manipulate an 
                        x86 program's memory and stack during runtime. There is also a console that supports some
                        functional operations including breakpoints (line and conditional), custom labelling, and 
                        more. Assembly from Ghidra can
                        be directly imported (so long as the instructions are functional and label references are 
                        resolvable).

                        feel free to explore this sandbox where you can upload your own images and convolve them with
                        custom kernels and see what happens!

            <p>
                I love music. I grew up playing guitar, the saxaphone, and french horn.
                Although I love many different types of genres of music, I have a special love for  
                electronic dance music (EDM). It inspired me to begin producing music, a hobby I continue today. 
                I first started using FL studio, my digital audio workstation (DAW), back
                when I was just 13 years old. Over a decade later, I'm still at it. Additionally, this love
                for music helped aim me in the direction of audio programming such as for my thesis (non-verbal vocal 
                interaction) and coding audio plugins!
                <br/><br/>
                Please enjoy some of my music via the provided Spotify web player below. My music is also on a variety
                of other streaming platforms, including Apple, Amazon Music, and Soundcloud.
