            <p>
                Hi Nat. If you're seeing this, this is the probably the last update I'll make to this page.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for being the best thing that's ever happened to me. At the same time, I went through some shit because
                I didn't know when to pull out (in every sense.) It's not your fault, so don't feel bad. But I've never had feelings
                for someone that have made me as happy and sad as I have had for you.
                <br><br>
                Since I am leaving school, it is time to officially move on. At the time of writing this, we've talked again but haven't met
                in person. I am finally (for real this time, not like last time) comfortable being just friends now. But, again, don't feel 
                bad if you can't or don't want it. I definitely have asked for a lot and you've been very generous giving me all the
                chances I've had. 
                <br><br>
                I hope to leave on good terms and keep in touch every now and then. You are beautiful inside and out. Don't ever forget that
                you made a man write paragraphs and paragraphs about how much he likes you. And no, it wasn't just to win you over. I still 
                stand by everything I've ever said about you.
                <br><br>
                We will probably never see eachother again after the end of this semester. I hope you have a great life ahead of you. I'm really glad you tried grad school and
                I hope everything works out. If nothing else, at least you've made some cow friends along the way.
                <br><br>
                If, somehow, our lives intersect in the future, I'd love to reconnect. Maybe even try what we had again. In another life, I really
                see myself with you (of course, this is just me and not you.) Either way, you'll definitely make another man (or cow) happy. 
                <br><br>
                I'm sorry if I've been a weird, obsessed, cringey, annoying person. But I've learned it's just who I am. I've also learned to grow in a lot
                of ways that I couldn't have without meeting you. I hope I was able to offer you something positive in your life like you have for me.
                <br><br>
                So here's to the future, Natalie. Thank you again for everything. In the words of Dan Fogelberg, you helped me learn that even losing
                men (men in CS) can win (amazing people like you in my life.) 
            </p>
