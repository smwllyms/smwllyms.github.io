            <p>
                I'm sorry for making this more complicated than it is. I have feelings for you
                that you don't have for me back. That's ok. You're also super busy and stressed.
                I don't wanna pile this mess on top of all that. You thought it was weird that I came to
                help you move out last semester and now don't trust me. I thought I needed to, but 
                you have every right to feel how you feel.
                <br/><br/>
                Hearing you say that on the phone made me realize I've been trying
                to salvage something lost long ago. You're beautiful and sweet and cute and everything
                I wanted and I didn't want to let you go. Now it's just too painful to pretend I don't 
                have feelings for you knowing you don't trust me either. But it's ok, I guess life 
                has other plans for us.
                <br/><br/>
                I'm sorry for all the hardship and stress I've caused. I know I've been an annoying
                little hopeless romantic. I hope I was able to make you happy at least a couple of times.
                If life worked differently I think we'd be a great pair. Maybe we'll cross paths again
                in the future.
                <br/><br/>
                Thank you for everything, Nat. I really wish you the best. Reach out if you're ever in trouble.
                You will always mean a lot to me.
            </p>
