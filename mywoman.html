            <p>
                This is the culmination of my computer science degree at Virginia Tech. This is actually the
                final for my class. They have to make this website in your honor. And no, I didn't use ChatGPT.
                <br/><br/>
                I'll be honest. I've modified this page a couple of times trying to figure out exactly what I want
                and how to say it. Part of this whole process for me is figuring out what I want to do with my life.
                Obviously I want you in it, but I need to be fair to you. First, let me apologize and explain what
                I've learned.
                <br/><br/>
                I never should have tried to force a romantic relationship with you. I completely messed up. We've 
                been through a lot. I had no right, obligation, or entitlement to anything. And because I wanted it 
                so bad I hurt you. I made our relationship about what I wanted and disregarded what you wanted. 
                Nobody has the right to do that. Relationships should be natural and organic. I realize now that 
                I was doing the opposite, and I am truly sorry.
                <br/><br/>
                I fell hard for you. You showed me what it was like to be happy and feel loved. And I am very thankful 
                for what we did have. I hope I was able to make you feel that way sometimes, too. You will be happy 
                and successful, I promise. If you ever need reassurance, you can scroll to our past texts and look at 
                one of the many paragraphs I've written about you. I'll never take any of it back.
                <br/><br/>
                Now, I want to be friends, but I understand I've probably lost trust and you are probably taking some space away from me.
                I still want you in my life because you really do make me happy and I like you a lot as a person. If you
                ever want to be friends again, please reach out. I will always be there if you need me.
                <br/><br/>
                But the <em>new</em> reality is that I don't think I will be staying in grad school. I just don't feel like
                it's what I truly want. And please don't jump to the conclusion I was staying here for you. It seemed
                like a good opportunity, but I realized I was looking at a Ph.D. as an end instead of a lifestyle (these
                nerds with Ph.D. do nerdy stuff their whole lives.)
                <br><br>
                I included a song at the bottom of the page and the lyrics are almost exactly how I feel. I listened to it a lot last semester; 
                it reminds me of you. Dan Fogelberg is a great, underrated artist. Maybe, like in the song, we will try again some day,
                if and when the time is right. But thanks for everything. In the words of Dan, something can be said for love that's pure.
                <br><br>
                I hope you aren't too affected by all this. I should have just said this here instead of texting you a drama novel. I blame Lacy, maybe if she
                showed me more love I wouldn't have desired it so much. Anyway, good luck with everything. I want to talk to you soon. 
                I hope you don't think of me as such a stupid slut sack now. Whatever happens, I will always be here for you.
