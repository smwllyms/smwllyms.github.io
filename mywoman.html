            <img id="us-bg" src="./img2/IMG_4712.jpg"></img>
            <p>
                This is the culmination of my computer science degree at Virginia Tech. This is actually the
                final for my class. They have to make this website in your honor. And no, I didn't use ChatGPT.
                <br/><br/>
                First,
                I want you to assure you that you don't owe me anything. You can cut me out
                of your life if it's really come to that. But I don't think it has.
                <br/><br/>
                I think that we are in the mess we are in because life is a fucking piece of shit
                 sometimes. I messed up a few times. You've told me that you are overwhelmed and not
                 ready for a relationship. You told me you have anxiety and narcolepsy, and I understand
                 that these limit your ability to provide what you think is enough for a relationship.
                <br/><br/>
                But Nat, I wouldn't still be here and keep trying if I didn't think that you are worth it, 
                beyond all those things. Do I need to remind you how hot, funny, down to earth and smart you are?
                No, maybe you can't integrate by parts, but you can integrate happiness into my life.
                <br/><br/>
                I want to just take a second and normalize who I am, since I feel like I've messed up my image over the past month. I've been anxious, stressed,
                overwhelmed. I crammed my Master's in last semester and now with teaching I've been scrambling every other day to 
                make my lecture slides for the next.  I let that spill into my relationship with you because I was looking
                for a source of happiness, escape and comfort. I realize I've been emotionally immature relationship wise. And you have been going through so much that
                it was like adding fuel to a fire.
                <br/><br/>
                So I've finally decided that I need to make this easier for both of us. I think the easiest
                way to do this is to just be honest and straight up. We've had quite a run. I don't want to
                hold you here if you don't want to be. But this is how I feel.
                <br/><br/>
                Like MLK Jr., I'm a dreamer. To quote Smash Mouth, I'm a believer. I believe we have something special. I believe
                I am lucky to have found you. I have a dream of being able to spend my time with you. Regardless of how you feel about yourself, you are more than a woman to me. 
                Instead of saying I want to spoil you again, I'll be specific. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I will be patient. I have learned that I need to respect you and give you the time and space you need.</li>
                    <li>I will get you a mini, fluffy cow (plushie, not a real one - yet). The ones you see on ads and stuff. And many more gifts.</li>
                    <li>I will support you. I will be someone you can absolutely trust. You can tell me everything you're comfortable sharing. Seriously, even how much you despise me.</li>
                    <li>I will stop texting so much. Instead, I'll do neat things like this, or just call or facetime you, depending on what's happening.</li>
                    <li>I will develop my skills. Yep. And not kiss so hard.</li>
                    <li>I will show you love...</li>
                </ul>
                <p> 
                Nat, one thing about our history is you've never opened up and given me a fair shot at this love thing. I
                know it's scary. But at some point you are bound to have to open yourself up and let somebody act on the 
                feelings they have for you. Hey, I get it, you might not feel so strongly about me. Maybe you don't see yourself as someone who can be or is deserving of love.
                But I know you, Natalie, and I want all of you. You make me happy. I want to make you happy. I want to spend time with you and be committed
                to you. It sounds like a lot, but it actually comes quite easy when it's real (no pun intended.) We will take it slow, or at whatever pace you'd like.
                <br/><br/>
                But it's a two way street. So if you don't want it, that's fine. But I've got to say, Nat. I want to be your man. I
                understand if you still need time or space. I understand that you will continue to need time and space, and that I won't be
                able to see you and talk to you all the time. But I'm asking
                you, honestly begging you, to please give me a chance to show you what this could be.
                <br/><br/>
                If you don't want this, take this as a message to leave in peace. No hard feelings. You're a sexy young broad in Blacksburg, go live it up.
                You deserve it after all you've been through. Or maybe it's just me, and maybe I'm just shooting way too high or am just being a weird creep to you. But if you have the
                feeling, even if it's just a spark, that you want to try this out with me one more time, and give me a fair chance, I beg you to
                consider that maybe our lives will be better. Please give me a shot, Nat.
                <br/><br/>
                Take the time you need. Focus on grad school while you need to. Like a son of Mumford, I will wait for you.
