            <p>
                The reason I came to your Oak Manor last year was because 
                I just wanted to make sure you were ok. Not only were we talking about me helping
                you and suddenly you changed your mind about needing help, but I was worried about your mental health. I'm sorry if it seemed inappropriate,
                but I do not regret it, and I would never do something like that unless I thought
                it was necessary. 
                <br/><br/>
                Speaking about this on the phone with you made it clear to me that the boundaries you have drawn
                are too big for me to be comfortable being friends, though I understand that maybe
                there was some miscommunication. But most importantly, I still have feelings for you. I can't lie to you.
                I realized that I am not capable at this point in time to be friends, which is why
                I am stepping away. 
                <br/><br/>
                I want to leave you with some idea of how I feel and how I've felt, even if it is wrong.
                I have put a lot into you, which is something I've done out of my own will. I've been
                holding on to reconnecting with you some day, but you've been so busy and drawn boundaries
                that have turned you into more of a dream than a real person to me. None of this
                is your fault. 
                <br/><br/>
                If I could have asked of one thing, I wish you would have been able to
                clearly tell me how you feel about me. I've never known if you just meant you literally could
                not "right now" or if that was just an excuse for not feeling the same way about me. I understand
                now how busy and stressed you are. I just never knew how you really felt. And like I've said,
                a lot of those things are trivial to me because I enjoy any amount of time I could get with you,
                no matter how little.
                <br/><br/>
                I know things will work out for you. Maybe we
                can reconnect in the future. I appreciate what we had and wish you the best, I know how busy
                and stressful grad school can be. I want the best for you, you're a great person. Thank you 
                for giving me a chance.
            </p>
