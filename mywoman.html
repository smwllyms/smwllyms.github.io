            <p>
                Here is one last essay for you. This is like my final exam. Only read it when you're
                not stressed and have time and energy.
                <br/><br/>
                I want to clarify how I see us. I really like you as a person and I think we have
                similar personalities, outlooks on things, and senses of humor. After I came to see
                you in Crozet, I feel like things fell off, and I've only seen you a handleful of
                times since. That said, I've continued to have feelings for you despite not seeing 
                you in person often. I realize there are things like narcolepsy and anxiety that affect
                this, not to mention that you've been super busy. I understand this might come out wrong,
                but, mostly because of the former things, seen you as a person who deserved, like, 
                special accomodations. This isn't to downplay how special and attractive of a person 
                I think you are, nor the fact that I'm a romantic who wanted to keep alive what we once
                had. So I've waited for you and been persistent. I'm sorry if this isn't what you 
                wanted or needed.
                <br/><br/>
                Going off of that, the reason I came to your Oak Manor last year was because 
                I just wanted to make sure you were ok. Not only were we talking about me helping
                you and suddenly you changed your mind about needing help and went radio-silent, 
                but I was worried about your mental health. I'm sorry if you thought it was wrong 
                for me to check on you anyways, but I don't regret it because I thought I was doing the right thing.
                Of course, I wanted to see you too.
                <br/><br/>
                Hearing you bring this up on the phone when we talked about watching Macy 
                made me realize that you have set some boundaries for me that have made me question
                everything. However, they are 
                completely up to you, and maybe there was some miscommunication that I have now addressed in the
                last paragraph. But I also realized I still have feelings for you. I can't live a lie to you. I don't want
                to hurt you and waste your time and energy and let you down again. Especially because you've never
                explicitly told me how you feel about me (just "not right now.") This has been especially frustrating
                seeing you talk with other guys (e.g., wrapping their arms around you at TOTs.) <em>Learn to communicate how you
                feel, Nat.</em> Regardless, I can't waste your time and energy,
                and this is probably for the better for both of us. 
                <br/><br/>
                All said, no hard feelings. I know grad school is busy and tough. Been there. I wish I
                had it in me to stick by your side. But I think it'll be better for you if I'm out of your
                mind, at least for the near future. Like I've said, maybe there is hope for us in the future.
                I felt something strong between us and besides time/availability. I just have no idea where or when that
                would even be possible since I'm leaving now, unfortunately. Life is a bitch. 
                Don't you dare settle for someone who won't spoil you. Regardless, thank you for everything, Nat. I know
                we haven't even see eachother much in the past year but you're a sweet girl and a hard worker
                for all you've been through and you're gonna do great. Thanks for giving me a chance.
